# Python-Hotel-Project
Data cleaning, transformation and insight generation for a hotel business via Python
## Project Background
Atliq has a hotel business unit that operates 25 hotels in 4 cities of India. With more than 100K+ booking records in 2022, some business insights of occupancy rate and revenue dependency are extracted from the date after data cleaning using Python.
## Dataset
There are 3 dimension tables for hotel, guest room and date details and 3 fact tables about actual bookings, aggregated bookings and a some newly generated booking data.
## Project:
In the project, I took 6 steps to analyze the data using Python. In the first 2 steps, I imported Pandas module and loaded all the datasets rom csv files.  After that, some exploratory analysis was done in step 3 to have an overview of all the datasets. And in step 4, some necessary data cleaning (like dealing with null values, outliers and unrealistic numbers) was done to prepare data for the analysis step. Then in step 5, the data was transformed by adding a new calculated column for occupancy rate, as well as appending new data to the existed data file. Last but not least, insights like monthly revenue, average occupancy rate for each room type, ratings for different cities are generated by grouping and performing aggregated calculations.
